# How to use this installation profile?
1.  Follow the usual preparation steps to prepare the Drupal installation:
    1.  [Download and uncompress Drupal](http://drupal.org/documentation/install/download)
    2.  [Create the database](http://drupal.org/documentation/install/create-database)
    3.  [The settings.php file](http://drupal.org/documentation/install/settings-file)
    4.  Be sure to  _not_  start the installation script just yet.
2.  Download or clone `os2forms` installation profile. If use downloaded version, remember to unpack it.
3.  Copy the entire directory that you just downloaded/cloned into the  `profiles`  directory located inside the Drupal root directory. 
For example, if you have a Drupal installation at  `/home/www/htdocs` , you would want to copy the entire `os2forms` directory into  `/home/www/htdocs/profiles/os2forms`. 
So the path looks like `/home/www/htdocs/profiles/os2forms/os2forms.profile`
5.  Go to your site's install.php to start the installation process.
6.  When you are presented with the option to select a profile, select your desired profile.
